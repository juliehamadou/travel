# Happy trip Gemma ! =)


## Restaurants

- *(American)* **Marlowe**, for the dreamy Polenta, one of the best veggie dishes ever (or maybe also Cow Marlowe, opened in 2018 in the Marina ?)
- *(Caf√©/Bakery)* **The Mill** for some of the best sourdough bread we tried, rye or wheat, good for breakfast
- *(Salad)* **Blue barn** for a good salad, personal favourite : the detox one
- *(Vegan)* **Seed and Salt** for all the yummy vegan food, and the cookie (that is as delicious as expensive)
- *(Vegan)* **Beloved Natural Cafe** : cutest vegan place ever, super tiny, all handmade, friendly
- *(Fine dining)* : **Nopa** where you can do it Thomas' style aka take a bunch of veggie starters as a main (reservations or waitlist)
- *(Fine dining)* : **Rich Table** (reservations or a few walk-ins accepted at the bar)

## Snacks

- *(Specialty Coffee)* **Saint Frank** on Polk, beautiful bright space and delicious coffee
- *(Specialty Coffee)* **Sightglass**, preferably the one on 7th street with the roastery
- *(Specialty Coffee)* **Wrecking Ball** (very small like 5 seats)
- *(Sweet Stuff)* **Mr Holmes Bakehouse** doughnuts and viennoiseries (recommended by Amanda from Boneshaker), for some of the best croissants ever (says a Parisian)
- *(Sweet Stuff)* **Susie Cakes** for cupcakes or *very* decadent layer-cakes

## Active Life 

- **Yoga Flow** on Union, the space is amazing
- **Laughing Lotus** is probably already on your list =)
- Personnal Rec : liked **Rumble** in New-York, so I'm excited to try it on my next SF visit. It's a fun workout, half boxing half Strength Training

## Places

- **Crissy Fields** great place to chill
- **Marshall's Beach**, nice view of the Golden Gate, off the beaten tracks (30 minutes walk from the road/nearest bus stop)
- **Land's End / Sutro Baths** walk along the coast
- watching the sunset on **Ocean Beach** 
- **Dolores Park** nice views of the city as well
- Nice views of the city from the top of **Buena Vista Park** (lots of trees) or **Corona Heights** (less trees, unobstructed view) 
- Personal Favourite : visiting the **Walt Disney's Family Museum** (I never get bored of this one)
- If in the area, **Williams & Sonoma** on Union Square deserves a glance, the building is so pretty
